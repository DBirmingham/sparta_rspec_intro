#Euler Project 2

##Introduction

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. In each project I've attempted to tackle one of these problems from the perspective of a Test Driven Developer.

##Task

To find the sum of every fibonacci number up to 4,000,000

##Running the tests

Simply running the command below in the terminal will run all of the tests provided you are in the right folder. In this case that is project_2
```
rspec
```

##Outcomes

Compared to project 1, this posed its own unique challenges with respect to the logic involved on the one hand but on the other I found it much harder to come up with clear and succinct tests in this problem. Overall it was a good exercise in understanding Ruby objects and rspec as a whole. rspec really does force you to learn the ins and outs of the code you write.

The problem was solved and all tests are currently passing.
