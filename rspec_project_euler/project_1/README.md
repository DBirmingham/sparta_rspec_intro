#Euler Project 1

##Introduction

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. In each project I've attempted to tackle one of these problems from the perspective of a Test Driven Developer.

##Task

To find the sum of every positive integer which is a multiple of 3 or 5 and is beneath 1000

##Running the tests

Simply running the command below in the terminal will run all of the tests provided you are in the right folder. In this case that is project_1
```
rspec
```

##Outcomes

Breaking the problem down into its component parts and programming from the tests rather than completely on the fly really does offer a new and useful point of view. It requires that you are aware of what your code is actually doing and as a result promotes better use of code.

The problem was solved and all tests are currently passing.
